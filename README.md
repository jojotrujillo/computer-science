<!-- "Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you need." (Matthew 6:33 NLT) -->

I found a good resource through the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) on topics within Computer Science that could be grouped into a curriculum.

Here's the link to a PDF copy of their recommendations: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3664191" target="_blank">Computer Science Curricula 2023</a>.

Below is a copy of the Body of Knowledge they outline in their recommended topics to study along with links to the respective sections within this repository that showcase what I've learned so far in those topics:
